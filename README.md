# Learning Clojure - YAY

## Roadmap (WIP)

What I've done so far that seems effective (I'm just starting out, will revisit this as I go):

1. Setup your dev env, get used to REPL-driven-development inside of the editor's buffer.
1. Start reading `Clojure For The Brave And True` - type out and try all the examples, it seems like a good general introduction
1. Start watching talks from Clojure confs to get yourself immersed/indoctrinated in Clojure, especially the Rich Hickey talks.
1. Koans/4clojure is probably a good way to get to know the core library a bit better
1. Finally start working on some small project like a simple game (`play-clj`) or a CRUD service (`reitit` seems pretty nice) 
1. ...
1. Profit!


## Development Environment

### NVIM (use nvim, it has better Clojure plugins)
* [Clojure in VIM 2020](https://blog.djy.io/conjuring-clojure-in-vim-2020-edition/)
* [Clojure in VIM - more](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/writing-clojure-in-vim)
* [Conjure demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lR2vbwuzrIM)

#### The plugins I use:
* `neoclide/coc.nvim` - LSP code completion, integration with linter, etc.
* `Olical/conjure` - For REPL driven development, let's you eval `forms` from the buffer
* `luochen1990/rainbow` - Colors matching ()
* `calebsmith/vim-lambdify` - Replaces `defn` and `fn` with Î»
* `bhurlow/vim-parinfer` - Simpler LISP editing
